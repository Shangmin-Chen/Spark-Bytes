# Spark! Bytes

## Overview
Spark Bytes is a web application designed for Boston University students and faculty to post events that offer free food or snacks. The goal is to minimize food waste by making surplus food from events more accessible to the BU community. This initiative not only helps students find free food but also promotes sustainability by reducing the waste generated from over-purchasing food for campus events.
